ping!

update completion for function types to complete like
b.call |->| {}    rather than  b.call(f)
Competion of method params (afte parenthesis
Completion with parameters broken ?

Check assignment types match
Check method params match

Import proposals(himts) / fixer (CTRL SHFT O)

blog about & have ant check for use of javax/swing/GroupLayout and error if it does
To fix:
- (select panel/design and in inspector right click root node/properties and chnage to not use java 1.6)
- (global: tools/options/gui builder)


============= TODO semantic checks =====================
for all check protection: private, internal etc...

Type(class)
-> check if all abstract overidden and marked override execpt if type is abstract
-> final cant be subclassed
-> const ????

Type(mixin)
# Mixins cannot declare concrete instance fields
# Mixins cannot declare constructors
# Mixins cannot declare once methods
# const ????

Type(Enum)
# Enums must have private constructors -> check if they are

Fields
-> Check name is unique
-> check value matches type
-> const fields (hard to check) can only be set in constructors and it blocks
-> readonly marked fields
-> in mixin only const/static or abstract fields

Variables:
-> check name unique
-> check was set with := before using =
-> check value matches type if present

static block
-> no 'this'

constructor
-> check constructor chain ('this' or 'super'), check that chained constructor exists
-> same as method (no this)

method
-> 'this' available
-> parameters
-> if static : no super
-> no 'this' in static
-> not using non static slots froma static one
-> check for virtual/abstract/override
-> Fantom supports covariance - which allows an overridden method to narrow the return type of the inherited method:
-> A method declared to return This is a special case of covariance which always returns the type being used

once method
-> meh
    * Must not be declared within a const class
    * Must not be declared within a mixin
    * Must not be a constructor
    * Must not be static
    * Must not be abstract
    * Must return non-Void
    * Must have no parameters

Closure / it blocks
-> it / this
-> check for variable conflict where either it or this is required

========== Currently Being worked on============================================
  - Add sub-menu to build.fan for running actions: doc,clean and others defined in BuildPod.fan (clean, native...)
  - Also have a "custom" option with text entry dialog to run user actions
  - Cleanup hard-coded strings (actions/menus etc...)
  - Change fan_home checks so that it hints to the problem if not executable(fan.exe on windows)
  - Check on this [[http://wiki.netbeans.org/PluginPortalQualityCriteria]] and submit to NB plugin portal.

========= Long term Goals ======================================================

- Semantic analysis
    -step 2: uses/misuses (4) - partialy done
    -step 3: with inheritance ? (5) - prob. need indexer
- Occurence finder (2)
- Rename / Refactor
    -Local: 2
    -Remote: 4
- Go to definition
    -Local:2
    -Remote:3
- Fix imports
    - Fan (3)
    - Java (5)
- Fix proposals
    - Impl missing methods (abstracts/virtual etc..)
    - Create method/class/mixin ...
