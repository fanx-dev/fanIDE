    *  Highlight variables in interpolated stringss $var MISSING_VALUE !

    * Change grammar to Allow $ in pod names (for java FFI)

    * Allow "run single" action only on runnable class main / scripts & build.fan

    * Have "build" "run" and "build & run" actions Pod itself as it works best, then hook up into NB "Run Mian Prj" button.

    * Create Main class with main() in it when creating pod (optional, default) as it's easier for beginners.

    * Add a "Main method" configurable field on pod props (defaults to podname:Main.main)

    * Research/Fix bug where new files don't show for a while (1 mn+) in files/projects ... only on some computers!

    * Research/Fix bug where navigator collapses after clicking an item in it.
