Review all the todos.

Delete outdated documents.

convert rootscope or typescope to serailizable form
type name, slots etc....
Example FanRootScope.index() - save socument,ttimestamp, type name,slots,fields etc...
	-> reindex/update when document is modified or moved(update doc url)
	-> remove all doc refs when doc deleted
	-> also save list of what's being used for quick where-used lookups ?
	-> and for refactor as well
	-> whereused table: Document - usedName - location (line# and/or range ?)
	-> at startup check DB and delete all documents that don't exist anymore
	-> then reindex all docs(source roots) with new timestamps (pob. chnaged outside of IDE)
		-> no?: source listener should detect that and invoke reindexing by itself
		-> should also detect a chnage froma  subversion pool -> test
	-> what if java document ? -> index by java indexer ?
then save -> json ? hsqldb/javadb ?
then use with indexer.

============= TODO Completion ===============================
- Fully resolve type of expressions (as much as I can)
- Add inherited slots (if not already defined - inherited)
	Mixin  can inherit 0 .. n mixins
	Enum ALWAYS inherit sys:ENUM and 0..n mixins
	Class can inherit 0..1 superclass and 0..n mixins
	
	Find parent slots:
	For Enum : check sys::Enum and inherited mixins
	For Mixin: check inherited mixins
	for Class: check supeclass, inherited mixins
	Need to note which pod, protection, const final and so on and wether virtual, abstract etc... (if duplicate, only keep closest definition)
-> Check local slot names against parents to see if all abstract are present, and if all "override" are overriding something and wether the one overriden is virtual
-> warn when parent is Java FFI and there are duplicate slot names (no overload)

- Filter proposals (Don't show innacessible items, private etc...)
- Do it, super(!= in method VS in type), namedSuper, this completion
if super. at type level, ovveride methods (fields?)
- Do expression resolving for vars without type
use resolveExpr ... add support fro "litterals" numbers, string etc...
when expression with + etc.. just resolve lefthandside TERM_EXPR? (should work)
- loop/throw variables (for Int i...)
- complete things like 2.times()
- ... caching ...

============= TODO semantic checks =====================
Deal with shortcut operators:
http://fantom.org/doc/docLang/Expressions.html#shortcuts

for all check protection: private, internal etc...

Type(class)
-> check name is unique (or marked override)
-> check if all abstract overidden and marked override execpt if type is abstract
-> final cant be subclassed
-> const ????

Type(mixin)
# Mixins cannot declare concrete instance fields
# Mixins cannot declare constructors
# Mixins cannot declare once methods
# const ????

Type(Enum)
# Enums must have private constructors -> check if they are

Fields
-> Check name is unique
-> check value matches type
-> const fields (hard to check) can only be set in constructors and it blocks
-> readonly marked fields
-> in mixin only const/static or abstract fields

Variables:
-> check name unique
-> check was set with := before using =
-> check value matches type if present

static block
-> no 'this'

constructor
-> check constructor chain ('this' or 'super'), check that chained constructor exists
-> same as method (no this)

method
-> 'this' available
-> parameters
-> if static : no super
-> no 'this' in static
-> not using non static slots froma static one
-> check for virtual/abstract/override
-> Fantom supports covariance - which allows an overridden method to narrow the return type of the inherited method:
-> A method declared to return This is a special case of covariance which always returns the type being used

once method
-> meh
    * Must not be declared within a const class
    * Must not be declared within a mixin
    * Must not be a constructor
    * Must not be static
    * Must not be abstract
    * Must return non-Void
    * Must have no parameters

Closure / it blocks
-> it / this
-> check for variable conflict where either it or this is required

===== Indexing ====
2 Index: "compiled" and "new"

Using FanPodIndexer for "compiled" pods (builtin Fan reflection)

On "reindex"(files changed in or out of editor) add to "temp" index, using AST tree from structureAnalyzer
On "compile" remove all types/files in the compile pod from "temp"

Search:
Search in "temp" index first.
Then using FanPodIndexer for "compiled" pods (builtin Fan reflection)

Persistance:
Persist to NB cache ? compiled doesn't need to - new probably does (or simply cache list of files and load them again in mem at startup ?)


========== Currently Being worked on============================================
  - [DONE] Fix Bug in license mport for Fan File template
  - [DONE] Fix Bug where main class name is not update in project props on pod creation.
  - [STARTED] Start working on completion for standard fan libs.
  - [STARTED] Start working on basic debugging.
  - Add sub-menu to build.fan for running actions: doc,clean and others defined in BuildPod.fan (clean, native...)
  - Also have a "custom" option with text entry dialog to run user actions
  - Cleanup hard-coded strings (actions/menus etc...)
  - Change fan_home checks so that it hints to the problem if not executable(fan.exe on windows)
  - Fix few parser issues (ternary expr?)
  - Check on this [[http://wiki.netbeans.org/PluginPortalQualityCriteria]] and submit to NB plugin portal.

========= Long term Goals ======================================================

- Semantic analysis
    - [DONE] step 1: highlighting (2)
    -step 2: uses/misuses (4)
    -step 3: with inheritance ? (5) - prob. need indexer
- Indexer
    -Platform with source/libs managment (4)
	-sourcemangement: local
	-sourcemangement: fan (fan_home)
	-sourcemangement: java ?
- Code completion
	-Std libraries(fan): 2
    -Local:3
    -Remote:5
	-Fandoc / Javadoc in compl. window
- Occurence finder (2)
- Pretty formatting (4)
- Rename / Refactor
    -Local: 2
    -Remote: 4
- Go to definition
    -Local:2
    -Remote:3
- Fix imports
    - Fan (3)
    - Java (5)
- Fix proposals
    - Impl missing methods (abstracts/virtual etc..)
    - Create method/class/mixin ...
