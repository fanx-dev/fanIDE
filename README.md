fantomidemodule
===============

Netbeans plugin module to support the Fantom Language (Also used by standalone fantomide project)

See more info about the FantomIde here: http://fantomide.colar.net/

Note that I also maintain a much leaner pure Fantom IDE called Camembert: http://www.status302.com/camembert
